# 📈 **Stock Market Analysis: AI-Powered Stock Prediction**  

## **Leveraging Machine Learning for Smarter Investment Decisions**  

Stock Market Analysis is a machine learning-driven application designed to predict stock prices using historical data and statistical modeling. Built with Python and Streamlit, it empowers investors to make data-driven financial decisions.  

---

## 🏗️ **Technology Stack & Architecture**  

This project integrates several key frameworks and libraries to ensure accurate stock forecasting and a seamless user experience:  

- **Streamlit** – Builds an interactive and user-friendly web interface.  
- **YFinance** – Retrieves real-time and historical stock market data from the Yahoo Finance API.  
- **StatsModels** – Implements the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting.  
- **Plotly** – Creates interactive and dynamic visualizations for historical and predicted stock prices.  

### **Application Workflow**  

1. The user selects a stock ticker.  
2. The application fetches historical price data via YFinance.  
3. The ARIMA model is trained on the retrieved dataset.  
4. The model generates multi-day stock price forecasts.  
5. The predicted stock prices are visualized using Plotly.
